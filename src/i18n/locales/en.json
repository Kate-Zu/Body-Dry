    "qaSupplements": "💊 Recommended supplements during drying/weight loss:\n\n• Multivitamins — to compensate for deficiencies with a restricted diet\n• Omega-3 (fish oil) — 1000-2000 mg/day for joints, heart and brain\n• Vitamin D3 — 2000-4000 IU/day, especially in winter\n• Magnesium — 200-400 mg/day (citrate or glycinate) for muscles and sleep\n• Calcium — 500-1000 mg/day if low dairy intake\n• Iron — only if blood tests indicate deficiency\n\n⚠️ Consult a doctor before taking supplements!",
    "qaMacros": "🥩 Macro recommendations based on your plan:\n\n• Protein (P): 1.6-2.2 g/kg — essential for preserving muscle during deficit. Sources: chicken, fish, eggs, cottage cheese, legumes.\n• Fats (F): 0.8-1.2 g/kg — needed for hormones, vitamin absorption. Sources: olive oil, nuts, avocado, fatty fish.\n• Carbs (C): remaining calories. Choose complex: grains, vegetables, legumes. Avoid sugar and white flour.\n\n📌 During drying, increase protein to 2.0-2.5 g/kg for maximum muscle preservation.",
    "qaMicro": "🧬 Key micronutrients:\n\n• Calcium (1000 mg) — bones, teeth, muscles. Sources: dairy, sesame, broccoli\n• Magnesium (400 mg) — muscles, nerves, sleep. Sources: nuts, buckwheat, spinach\n• Iron (8-18 mg) — blood, energy. Sources: meat, liver, legumes\n• Zinc (8-11 mg) — immunity, hormones. Sources: meat, pumpkin seeds\n• Potassium (3500 mg) — heart, muscles. Sources: bananas, potatoes, avocado\n• Sodium — limit to 2300 mg/day\n\n⚠️ With calorie deficit, deficiency risk increases — eat diverse foods.",
    "qaWater": "💧 Water recommendations:\n\n• Base norm: 30-35 ml per 1 kg body weight per day\n• With training: +500 ml per hour of exercise\n• During drying/weight loss: increase by 20% to support metabolism\n• Distribution: 200-300 ml every hour, no more than 500 ml at once\n\n📌 Dehydration signs: dark urine, dry mouth, headache, fatigue.",
    "qaProteinSupp": "🥛 Protein supplements:\n\n• Whey — fast absorption, ideal post-workout. 25-30 g per serving.\n• Casein — slow absorption, great before bed. 25-30 g.\n• Isolate — for lactose intolerant. Minimal fats and carbs.\n\n⚠️ Supplements don't replace real food! Get most protein from whole foods.",
    "qaOmega": "🐟 Omega-3 fatty acids:\n\n• Recommended dose: 1000-2000 mg EPA+DHA per day\n• Food sources: salmon, mackerel, sardines, walnuts, flaxseed\n• Benefits: heart, joint, brain health, reduced inflammation\n• During drying, especially important for joints and hormonal balance\n\n📌 Take with fatty foods for better absorption.",
    "qaCreatine": "💪 Creatine monohydrate:\n\n• Dose: 3-5 g per day, every day\n• Helps preserve strength and muscle mass during calorie deficit\n• May retain 1-2 kg of water — this is normal, not fat\n• Safe for long-term use\n\n📌 Drink enough water when taking creatine.",
    "qaMealTiming": "⏰ Meal frequency:\n\n• Optimal: 3-5 meals per day (3 main + 1-2 snacks)\n• Interval between meals: 3-4 hours\n• Distribute protein evenly (25-40 g per meal)\n• Last meal: 2-3 hours before bedtime\n\n📌 What matters most is total daily calories and macros, not exact timing.",
    "qaCalories": "🔥 Calories and your plan:\n\nYour calculated maintenance already accounts for activity level. A 15-20% deficit is optimal for healthy weight loss. A larger deficit (>25%) can lead to muscle loss, metabolic slowdown and binge eating.\n\n📌 Check weight weekly. If no change after 2 weeks — adjust by 100-200 kcal.",
    "qaPlateau": "📊 How to overcome plateau:\n\n1. Refeed day — 1 day at maintenance calories (once every 1-2 weeks)\n2. Increase physical activity (add cardio or increase intensity)\n3. Change macro ratios (increase protein)\n4. Check hidden calories (sauces, drinks, snacks)\n5. Diet break — 1-2 weeks at maintenance, then resume deficit\n\n⚠️ Plateaus are normal. Don't cut calories below the safe minimum!",
    "qaSleep": "😴 Sleep and recovery:\n\n• 7-9 hours of sleep is critical for weight loss and drying\n• Sleep deprivation raises cortisol (stress hormone), which retains water and slows fat burning\n• Growth hormone (important for muscles) is released primarily during sleep\n\n📌 Tips: consistent bedtime, dark room, no screens 1 hour before bed, temperature 18-20°C.",
